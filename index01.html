    <h2 id="heading2"> BY SRUSHTI CHOUDHARI</h2>
    <p>Trees are the best gift of nature for us. They make the environment beautiful and clean. Water and sunlight are very important to help trees grow. Human beings get food from trees. Trees also give us wood and shade. Houses, chairs and toys are made from wood we receive from trees.

        Trees can be called the best friend to mankind. Many animals get their food from leaves, vegetables and fruits grown on trees. They also live near the shadow of trees. We should stop cutting trees to save nature. Children and adults need to plant more trees and teach each other to stop causing harm to nature. One tree can save many lives.
